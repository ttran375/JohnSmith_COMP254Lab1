# Lab Assignment #1 -- Using Fundamental Data Structures

## Exercise 1

**If your first name starts with a letter from A-J inclusively:**

Add a method *swapTwoNodes* to *SinglyLinkedList* class from week 2
lecture examples. This method should swap two nodes *node1* and *node2*
(and not just their contents) given references only to *node1* and
*node2*. The new method should check if *node1* and *node2* are the same
node, etc. Write the main method to test the *swapTwoNodes* method.
**Hint**: You may need to traverse the list.

**If your first name starts with a letter from K-Z inclusively:**

Add a method *swapTwoNodes* to *DoublyLinkedList* class from week 2
lecture examples. This method should swap two nodes *node1* and *node2*
(and not just their contents) given references only to *node1* and
*node2*. The new method should check if *node1* and *node2* are the same
node, etc. Write the main method to test the *swapTwoNodes* method.
**Hint**: You may need to traverse the list.

## Exercise 2

**If your first name starts with a letter from A-J inclusively:**

Use the *SinglyLinkedList* implementation of the textbook (week 2
lecture examples. Write a method for **concatenating two singly linked
lists L1 and L2**, into a single list L that contains all the nodes of
L1 followed by all the nodes of L2. Write a main method to test the new
method. **Hint**: Connect the end of L1 into the beginning of L2.

**If your first name starts with a letter from K-Z inclusively:**

Use the *DoublyLinkedList* implementation of the textbook (week 2
lecture examples. Write a method for **concatenating two doubly linked
lists L1 and L2**, into a single list L that contains all the nodes of
L1 followed by all the nodes of L2. Write a main method to test the new
method. **Hint**: Connect the end of L1 into the beginning of L2.

## Exercise 3

**If your first name starts with a letter from A-J inclusively:**

Implement the **clone() method** for the CircularlyLinkedList class.
Make sure to properly link the new chain of nodes.

**If your first name starts with a letter from K-Z inclusively:**

Let L1 and L2 be two circularly linked lists created as objects of
CircularlyLinkedList class from Lesson. Write a method that returns
*true* if L1 and L2 store the same sequence of elements (but perhaps
with different starting points). Write the main method to test the new
method. **Hint**: Try to find a matching alignment for the first node of
one list.
